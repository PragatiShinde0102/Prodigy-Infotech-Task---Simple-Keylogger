# 🔑 Ethical Keylogger Simulator (Internship Project)

This project is a **Python-based GUI application** that simulates a keystroke logger in a safe and ethical environment.  
It is designed purely for **educational and internship purposes** to demonstrate how logging mechanisms work and to highlight the importance of **awareness in cybersecurity**.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Start/Stop Logging**: Control when keystroke recording begins and ends.
- **Real-Time Counter**: Displays the number of keystrokes logged.
- **Log Management**:
  - Save keystrokes to a text file
  - View logs within the app
  - Clear stored logs instantly
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter for an interactive GUI.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project
The main objective of this project is to:
- Showcase the **working of keystroke logging** in a transparent and controlled way.
- Emphasize the **ethical use** of such tools in cybersecurity research.
- Demonstrate proficiency in **Python GUI development** and **file handling**.
- Reflect understanding of how attackers might exploit such tools, while advocating for **defensive security measures**.
